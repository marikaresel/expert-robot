# Python - Crude Suicide Rates Analysis 

Introduction:
The purpose of this project was to analyze suicide death data to uncover conditions most strongly associated with the deaths, analyze geographical variations and understand temporal trends and seasonal patterns.

Skills:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Geographical Analysis
Regression Analysis
Cluster Analysis
Time series Analysis

Goals:
Identify conditions most strongly associated with suicide deaths. 
Analyze geographical variations in suicide death rates.

Approach and Process:

Data Preparation: 
 Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
 Merged suicide deaths data with crude rates of all ages and geographical information. 
Geographical Analysis: 
 Created choropleth maps linear regression models to predict suicide deaths based on condition mentions. 
Cluster Analysis:
 Applied K-means clustering to visualize total suicide deaths and death rates across states. 
Regression Analysis: 
 Built and evaluated to identify clusters of states with similar suicide impact levels.
 Time Series Analysis: 
 Decomposed time-series data to understand trends and seasonal patterns in suicide deaths.
